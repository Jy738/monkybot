# monkybot
a bot i made using Discord.js V12. its a random message generator that i called monkybot due to it fittingly talking as if it were a real monkey at a pc.

you can set it up by going to the folder with the index.js file and running the command 'npm install discord.js@12.0.0'
after that replace the client.login string with your bots token and replace the botid const at the top with your bots id, this is important so it doesnt inifinitely respond to itself. after this you're done, just run 'node index.js'
